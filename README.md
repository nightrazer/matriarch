These Projects are developed in C# under Windows10 with use of the VisualStudio Community Edition.
I have developed these with the help from documentation, books, advice and troubble shooting.
As of 2018-04-10 I have released my first Alpha version of Backpacker. It is not a game, or a useful application.
It's purpose is store strings, nullify the content and to write as bugfree code as possible.

All the projects done here are only for educational use and shows how I develop as a C# developer.
If you have any questions or advice I would like that very much. I am at the beginning of my education.

You will find Diagrams of how the Programs are made as well as comments on the different sections
They are developed mostly as instructed with a few creative twists.
